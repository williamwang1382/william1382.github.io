                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a third-year student at McGill University, majoring in Software Engineering. I am currently looking for an internship during the Winter 2024 term or during Summer 2024. 
                    I am interested in software development, data science, web development and although still a beginner, I have grown an interest in machine learning as well. My main skills are 
                    Java, Python, C, Linux, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Git, JUnit, and AWS EC2 are tools I am familiar with. I am a quick learner and am always ready to learn new skills.
